Comprehensive Prediction of Depressed Patients using Machine Learning Techniques and it’s Outcome Assessment...
The use of wearable sensor technologies has grown in popularity as a means of tracking many facets of human activity.In this paper, a unique dataset consisting of motor activity recordings from patients with depression have been analysed .These activity data help to detect various mental health issues such as changes in mood, personality, inability to cope with daily problems or stress and withdrawal from friends and activities. Here machine learning methods have been deployed to classify people into sad and non-depressed groups.The dataset consists of actigraph data as well as clinical scores, such as MADRS(Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale) and detailing about the patients' psychiatric conditions.The dataset contains motor activity recordings of 23 unipolar and bipolar depressed patients and 32 healthy controls. Machine learning models specifically Random Forest Classifier & Decision Tree Classifier have been applied for multiple classification tasks, including prediction of the level of depression of patient before treatment, prediction of the level of depression of patient after treatment,classification of the type of depression of patient’s (e.g., bipolar II, unipolar depressive), determination of  the patient's status (inpatient or outpatient), assessment of the improvement in depression after treatment , classification of marital status of patients, identification of melancholic conditions of patients and also classification of patients on the basis of their works(e.g. working or studying,unemployed/sick leave/pension) have be addressed .Furthermore we augment the dataset size using Genetic algorithms, employing CrossOver technique to expand the dataset. All eight machine learning prediction models are applied to this synthetic dataset to assess the generalizability of all models.Model performance and reliability across varying data volumes can be understood through comparative studies between the original and expanded datasets.Additional analyses also measured the influence of model predictions on a range of characteristics, including gender, afftype, work status, marital status, melancholic/non-melancholic status, and patient status. Analyses that are specific to the model showed how patients are distributed across various depression levels, types of depression, improvement in condition, and classification according to expected characteristics. Through the use of machine learning techniques, these analyses advance our understanding of depression classification and attribute prediction.
